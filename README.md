# ciSco-Ios-Configuration-generatOr (SICO)
Cisco IOS Configuration Generator (SICO) written in Perl using simple HTML web forms as input.

I plan to create multiple template configuration files to allow for complete and partial configurations for Cisco IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS and Cisco Small Business switches and routers.

Gratitude goes to the original author, Ken Celenza from It Depends Networks.

Warning! This project is in alpha as f'k stage. It probably is broken at any given moment. I am using this project to learn Git and refresh my Pearl skills before tackling Python scripting while solving some immediate problems.

To Do:
  1) Fix sico.pl to reflect changes in files and directories.
  2) Write setup instructions for apache2 and lighttpd.
  3) Update this readme with more detail.
