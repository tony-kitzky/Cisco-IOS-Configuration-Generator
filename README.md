# Cisco-IOS-Configuration-Generator
Cisco IOS Configuration Generator written in Perl using simple HTML web forms as input.

Plan to create multiple template files to allow for complete and partial configurations for Cisco IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS and other devices.

To Do:
  1) Write setup instructions for apache2 and lighttpd.
  2) Update this readme with more detail.

Gratitude goes to the original author, Ken Celenza from It Depends Networks.

I am using this project to learn Git and refresh my Pearl skills before tackling Python scripting while solving some immediate problems.
